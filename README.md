# Python EDA with a Real YouTube Data Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on the 2023 Global YouTube Statistics dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in YouTube video and channel data.

- ## Dataset Overview


The dataset used in this project contains global statistics on YouTube channels and videos from 2023. It includes information such as:

- Video views
- Subscriber counts
- Video uploads
- Channel and video descriptions
- And other key metrics for analysing YouTube's performance globally.


## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to leverage Python's powerful data analysis libraries (such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualise key insights related to YouTube video performance and trends
- Answer questions related to the global distribution of video content, channel engagement, and more.


## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/valerijarudjko/youtube-data-analysis-python.git


2. Set Up the Environment

- Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python


3. Download Youtube Sales Data: [Youtube dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023)


4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
- Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries using:
```bash
pandas matplotlib.pyplot numpy seaborn
```
- Loading Data: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

  
5. Explore the Data

- Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
- Analysis: Use functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.


6. Data Cleaning
- Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
- Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime).
- Validation: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.


7. Data Visualisation
- Use installed libraries for your data visalisation.
- Example: Bar chart
