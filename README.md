# Python EDA with a Real YouTube Data Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on the 2023 Global YouTube Statistics dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in YouTube video and channel data.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains global statistics on YouTube channels and videos from 2023. It includes information such as:

- Video views
- Subscriber counts
- Video uploads
- Channel and video descriptions
- And other key metrics for analysing YouTube's performance globally.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to leverage Python's powerful data analysis libraries (such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualise key insights related to YouTube video performance and trends
- Answer questions related to the global distribution of video content, channel engagement, and more.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
